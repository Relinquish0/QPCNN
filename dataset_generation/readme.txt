Here is the data generation section, divided into correlated and uncorrelated parts
correlated is used to generate the training phase and output phase
uncorrelated is for generating pre-training.
The first step is to open the bell - program (thanks to Chen Jixuan's code) to generate Born's rule results
Then open the corresponding notepad and copy and paste it into excel,
Note that Brother's code is in write mode, so the planner must be cleared before running the code

Change your name to something you recognize, and change the address in your code
Here with me
data_bell_uncorrelated_train		The pretraining section is a training set
data_bell_uncorrelated_validation	The test set for the pretraining section
data_bell_correlated_train			training section of the training set
data_bell_correlated_validation		The test set for the training section
data_bell_correlated_output		training part of the deduction set

Then open their respective data_preset runs, and note the comments in the code
measured means the measured result pm after they have done N=100,000 tests




这里是数据生成部分，分correlated和uncorrelated两部分
correlated是为了生成training phase和output phase的
uncorrelated是为了生成pre-training的。
首先要打开bell—的程序（感谢陈骥萱师兄的代码）生成Born's rule的结果
接着打开相应的记事本复制粘贴到excel表格中，
注意师兄的代码里面是write模式，所以运行代码前务记事本必要清空

改名为自己认得清的名字，并且修改代码内的地址
在我这里
data_bell_uncorrelated_train		pretraining部分的训练集
data_bell_uncorrelated_validation	pretraining部分的测试集
data_bell_correlated_train			training部分的训练集
data_bell_correlated_validation		training部分的测试集
data_bell_correlated_output		training部分的推演集

接着打开各自的data_preset运行就好了，注意代码里面的注释
measured表示他们做过N=100,000次试验后统计的结果pm
